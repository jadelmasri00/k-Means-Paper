## Overview
Determining the correct number of clusters is a long-standing challenge in K-means clustering.  
Traditional methods such as the **Elbow method**, **Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)**, **Calinski-Harabasz**, and **Xie-Beni** often fail on complex datasets.

This work introduces **d-packing**, a dynamic distanceâ€“based selection method that:  
- Consistently identifies the true number of clusters across **dense, sparse, overlapping, and non-overlapping** datasets.  
- Outperforms conventional approaches in both **accuracy** and **robustness**.  
- Provides a more **generalizable framework** for clustering problems.

## Code Availability
The implementation and experiments are currently **private** while the paper is under review.  
They will be released in this repository after the review process.
